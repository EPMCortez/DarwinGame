# DarwinGame
This game is a part of my Masters of Education Thesis

-- About me --   
My name is Eduardo Cortez, I am a graduate student enrolled at the Science Teaching Inter-Units Program of the University of SÃ£o Paulo,
Brazil. My objective is to develop a new approach to address Charles Darwin's (1809-1882) history, discussing aspects of nature of science
regarding the development of his first ideas on natural selection. More specifically, I bring to light the fact that he never worked alone,
and, with this approach, I bring to the classroom discussions on how a scienctist works and how science can be seen as an collective
interprise.

The game is, at the present, only in its Portuguese version and it is called "Uma Ideia Perigosa?", whcih translates to "A Dangerous Idea?"
(an English Version is coming soon). Following some authors like Douglas Allchin and Don Metz, who argue that history and philosophy of 
science can be brought into class within an storytelling approach, I propose that an RPG game can be a manner of telling such a story.

-- About the game --   
Inicial development has been made with RPG Maker MV, and deployment to files able to be built into an app was made with Intel XDK.
The story told here puts the player in the shoes of Syms Covington (1816-1861), a boy who was a fiddler on board of HMS Beagle, but then
was hired by Charles Darwin in order to help him shooting birds and other animals, stuffing them, and sending them back to England.
The game's storyline represents the years 1836-1839 when, back to England, Darwin and Covington start analysing the collected material, and
when Darwin writes the first formulation about natural selection on his secret notebooks.

-- On modifying the game --   
Feel free to create how many branches you want to adapt and modify the game, but please notice it has been developed as a product of deep
studies into history of science in order for it to remain faithfull to Darwin's and nineteenth-century England's history. Any deep modi-
fications will change this scholar character.
Anyway, please remember to attribute the credits to Eduardo Cortez, 2017.
